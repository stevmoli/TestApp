# TestApp

## A blog Rails app developed to practice using Rails

Users can create accounts (a password salt is implemented, and passwords are encrypted using the bcrypt gem).  With an account, a user has the ability to create posts, comment on any post, and edit or delete their own posts and comments.  A user cannot edit or delete posts or comments that do not belong to them.

## Todo
* I am in the middle of adding CSS to the project.  I am using the materialize-sass gem in order to use the Materialize front-end framework: http://materializecss.com/
* I would like to give users the ability to include images in their posts and comments.
